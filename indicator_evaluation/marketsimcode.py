"""
An improved version of your marketsim code accepts a “trades” DataFrame (instead of a file).
More info on the trades data frame is below. It is OK not to submit this file if you
have subsumed its functionality into one of your other required code files.
This file has a different name and a slightly different setup than your previous project.
However, that solution can be used with several edits for the new requirements.
